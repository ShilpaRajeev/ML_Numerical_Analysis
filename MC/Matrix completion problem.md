## Matrix completion problem
- Problem: Complete partially observed low-rank matrix
- Assumption: Low rank r<< min(n,d)
- Approach: Convex relaxation 
    - replace rank with Nuclear norm
    - Provable recovery guarantees
- Algorithm: SVT

### Low rank assumption


Rank Minimization
convex and non-convex function
Nuclear norm of a Matrix 
    (singular values - how to find)
sparse vector
Why does Nuclear norm work
SVT
Soft thresholding
